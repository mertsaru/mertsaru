Hi, I'm Mert â€“ a passionate Machine Learning & AI Engineer based in Germany.

By day, I work on real-world AI solutionsâ€”building custom LLMs, optimizing ML pipelines, and deploying intelligent systems. From real-time object detection to multilingual RAG chatbots and time-series forecasting, I love turning complex problems into production-ready AI tools.

By night, you'll find me experimenting with my own custom LLM stack and working on a stock forecasting platform powered by AI.


ðŸ“¡ Side interests:
Running my own home server, automating my smart home, and tinkering with generative AI systems.

Letâ€™s connect or collaborateâ€”whether you're into AI systems, forecasting models, or just want to nerd out over LLM internals.

- My skills include:
    - Computer Vision
    - Forecasting with ML
    - LLM development
    - RAG development
